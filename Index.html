<h2><strong>Core Concepts of Effective Presentations</strong></h2>
<h3>Communication Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your primary objectives:</li>
<li><strong>Get your message received:</strong> Eliminate noise and distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure understanding:</strong> Define unfamiliar terms, avoid jargon your audience doesn’t know.</li>
<li><strong>Achieve audience embrace:</strong> Especially in persuasive presentations, move the audience to your side (e.g., agreeing, buying, signing up).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You have to make sure they understand your message, and then make sure they embrace your message.&quot;

</blockquote>
<h3>Know Your Audience</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audience Profile:</strong> Before preparing, assess:</li>
<li>What do they already know?</li>
<li>What do they <strong>not</strong> know?</li>
<li>What do they value and care about?</li>
<li><strong>Implications:</strong> Your definitions, examples, and word choices depend on this analysis.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Defining Your Presentation Purpose</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Distill your purpose into one sentence.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>*E.g., “Our company’s market share is steadily declining (problem). My purpose is to explore new ways of promoting and selling products and recommend a</li>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Clarify for yourself and your audience:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What’s their common problem?</li>
<li>How will you solve it?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The GPS Strategy</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>G</strong>: Where is your audience now? <em>(Current status/understanding/attitude)</em></li>
<li><strong>P</strong>: Where do you want them to go? <em>(Your proposed solution/goal)</em></li>
<li><strong>S</strong>: What path will get them there? <em>(Persuasive appeals &amp; logical steps)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Presentation Structure (Essay Analogy)</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> (&quot;Guess what?&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Body</strong> (&quot;So what?&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong> (&quot;Now what?&quot;)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bookend Principle:</strong> Strong <em>introduction</em> and <em>conclusion</em> are fundamental—they hold everything together.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Introduction ABCDs</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>A</strong>ttention</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grab attention</strong>—first words out of your mouth!</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> You have just <strong>3 seconds</strong> to capture the audience. Otherwise, you’ll lose them to distractions.</li>
<li><strong>What not to do:</strong> Don’t begin with your name, job history, or self-introduction; 90% of presentations do this and it rarely works!</li>
</ul>
<h4><em>Attention-Getting Techniques:</em></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facts/Statistics</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Surprising or relevant facts to stimulate interest.</li>
<li><em>Example: “Did you know malaria may have killed half of all people who ever lived?”</em></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Rhetorical or direct; encourage engagement.</li>
<li>Pair with a related fact for impact.</li>
<li><em>Example: “Who wants to make a million dollars legally?”</em></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Stories</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Brief, memorable anecdotes tied to your message.</li>
<li>Stories increase retention and create emotional hooks.</li>
<li><em>Example: Richard Branson’s founding of Virgin Airlines after poor service from a competitor.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The number one rule in the presentation is that you don't <em>lose</em> your audience.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your attention-getter must be relevant.</strong></li>
<li>Avoid unrelated icebreakers or surface-level questions (“Raise your hand if you’ve heard of Amazon…”).</li>
<li><strong>Best:</strong> Tie attention-getter to a <strong>problem</strong> your presentation will solve.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>B</strong>enefit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>After engaging attention, highlight the main benefit.</strong></li>
<li>Why should the audience care?</li>
<li>Frame the benefit as a solution to their problem.</li>
<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Anchor the <em>biggest benefit</em> from your intro, expanding more in the body.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>C</strong>redibility</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show the audience why they should trust you.</strong></li>
<li>Offer credentials briefly—don’t overdo your achievements.</li>
<li><em>Example: “I’m a user of this product for 10 years and learned new skills through it.”</em></li>
<li><strong>Methods:</strong></li>
<li>Share your role/experience only when relevant.</li>
<li>Display confidence, use positive body language.</li>
<li>Sprinkle credibility throughout—not just at the start.</li>
<li>Dress appropriately for added instant credibility.</li>
<li><em>Credibility mistake:</em> Over-promising then under-delivering destroys trust!</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>D</strong>irection</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Give a roadmap for the presentation (“Direction”).</strong></li>
<li>Tell them what to expect.</li>
<li>Use previews: “We’ll cover A, B, and C, ending with Q&amp;A.”</li>
<li>Keep them updated during transitions (“Now that we’ve covered X, let’s move to Y.”)</li>
<li><strong>Signposting:</strong> Use agenda/transition slides and visual cues to orient your audience.</li>
<li><em>Tour Guide Analogy:</em> Never lose your audience—they should always know where they are.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Body of the Presentation: Prove Your Case!</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Persuasive Appeals</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ethos</strong> (credibility, trustworthiness)</li>
<li><strong>Pathos</strong> (emotional connection, story, imagery)</li>
<li><strong>Logos</strong> (logic, data, statistics)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature vs. Benefit:</strong></li>
<li><em>Feature</em>: What something is (e.g., 1 GB of storage).</li>
<li><em>Benefit</em>: What it means for the audience (“1,000 songs in your pocket.”)</li>
<li><strong>Continually link back to the main problem and solution/benefit.</strong></li>
<li>Use <strong>visual cues</strong> (headers, markers, agenda slides) to show progression.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Conclusion Structure (ABCD)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>A</strong>nnounce</h3>
<ul>
<li>Signal you’re wrapping up with a clear transition (“In conclusion…” or visual cue).</li>
<li>Prevents your audience from feeling lost as you close.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>B</strong>enefit (Recap)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Restate the main benefit(s) from intro and body.</li>
<li>Reinforce what’s in it for the audience.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>C</strong>all to Action (CTA)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Directly state what you want your audience to do.</li>
<li>Use persuasive principles like urgency or social proof (e.g., “Sign up now—spots are limited!”).</li>
<li>QR codes, testimonials, discounts, or stats can be effective.</li>
<li><strong>Be confident.</strong> Avoid language like “I hope you might consider…”</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>D</strong>eliver (Strong Ending)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Come full circle—connect your ending to your original attention-getter.</li>
<li>Repeat fact/question/story from your opening for closure.</li>
<li>Leave a strong, memorable statement or quote.</li>
<li>End on your own terms: avoid “That’s it… so, yeah…”—memorize your final line.</li>
<li>Finish with a “Thank you,” and let the applause begin.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Presentation Slide Design Tips</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slides should support—not distract from—your speech.</strong></li>
<li>Have a dedicated slide for each ABCD element:</li>
<li>Attention (Fact/Question/Story)—display the key text/image.</li>
<li>Benefit—bold, concise summary.</li>
<li>Credibility—team/company intro with images/names.</li>
<li>Direction—visual agenda/roadmap.</li>
<li>Announce/transition—visual cue that the conclusion has started.</li>
<li>CTA—clear, with helpful tools (QR, brief instructions).</li>
<li>Delivery—closing thought or quote.</li>
<li><strong>Less is more:</strong> Minimize text, use bold visuals and narrative images.</li>
<li><strong>Credible visuals:</strong> Use high-quality images, and cite any data sources if appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Best Practices &amp; Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memorize your opening, closing, and transitions—these are most vital.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Audience retention hinges on strong introductions and conclusions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Never start with your bio—begin by engaging the audience.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be the confident tour guide—never let your audience get lost.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strong, clear, enthusiastic delivery builds trust and drives action.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tie everything back to the audience’s needs and your core message.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Next Steps / Homework</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brainstorm the ABCDs</strong> for your presentation intro/conclusion and submit via discussion post.</li>
<li>Only one member needs to submit for the group; others report their contributions.</li>
<li>Due: Apply the <em>mulligan</em> if submitting by Sunday, March 30th.</li>
